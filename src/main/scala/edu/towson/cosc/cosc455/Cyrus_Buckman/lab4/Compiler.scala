  * COSC 455 Programming Languages: Implementation and Design
  * Lab 4 - A Simple Compiler
  * Josh Dehlinger
  * A simple compiler used for the simple English grammar in Section 2.2 of Adam Brooks Weber's
  * "Modern Programming Languages" book. Parts of this code was adapted from Robert Sebesta's "Concepts
  * of Programming Languages".
  *
  * This compiler assumes that the source file containing the sentences to parse are provided as the first
  * runtime argument. Within the source file, the compiler assumes that each sentence to parse is provided
  * on its own line.
